# R2-D2 Morse Code Translator

A web-based Morse code translator built for the Rebel Alliance to encode and decode secret messages. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project helps R2-D2 communicate with C-3PO and pull some encrypted pranks!

## Features
- **Encode**: Convert text (letters, numbers, punctuation) to Morse code (e.g., "HELP" → ".... . .-.. .--.").
- **Decode**: Convert Morse code back to text (e.g., ".... .- ...- . / -.-- --- ..-" → "HAVE YOU").
- Handles empty inputs and invalid characters with error messages.
- Clean, responsive GUI with a Star Wars vibe.
